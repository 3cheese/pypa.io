PyPA Specifications
===================

In addition to maintaining the default implementation of the Python packaging
toolchain, the Python Packaging Authority is also responsible for maintaining
the interoperability specifications used to define the interactions between
those tools.

Specification Process
---------------------

PyPA interoperability specifications are currently handled as Informational
Python Enhancement Proposals in accordance with :pep:`1`.

Whenever a new PEP is put forward on distutils-sig, any PyPA core
reviewer that believes they are suitably experienced to make the final
decision on that PEP may offer to serve as the BDFL's delegate (or
"PEP czar") for that PEP. If their self-nomination is accepted by the
other PyPA core reviewers, the lead PyPI maintainer and the lead
CPython representative on distutils-sig, then they will have the
authority to approve (or reject) that PEP.

The current lead PyPI maintainer is Donald Stufft, while the current lead
CPython representative on distutils-sig is Nick Coghlan.


Active Specifications
---------------------

The currently active specifications are recorded as a part of the
:ref:`Python Packaging User Guide <pypug:specifications>`.
